# Fantastec Demo

To run:

- clone from repo
- `nvm use 10.0.0`
- cd into project and `yarn install`
- create two terminals

* First Terminal: `yarn run mocks` (this will default to PORT 3000)
* Second Terminal: `yarn start` (terminal will ask you if "you wish to use a different terminal instead?", move to PORT 3001)

Project is split into two sections:

Containers (stateful, logic included)
Components (mostly dumb, reuseable - though the updates container has evolved to require some state/logic)

The project is built using React (CRA).
Redux (for state management).
Redux Sagas (for managing async/API data).
Jest/Enzyme for unit tests.
Json-server as a mock api serving an array of objects similar to those you'd find on a regular API.
